I like any movie that has vampires in it .
The best cartoons are " The Family Guy , " " The Simpsons , " " Futurama , " and " South Park . "
Funny , but I have it before , now .
I joined the new organi@@ zation Rap@@ t is C@@ ra * p .
Yes , this show can be addictive .
Th@@ us , I no longer believe in the concept of " true friends . "
This is supposed to the the case with mu@@ f@@ fin@@ s , but is not intelligent for either case .
Fur@@ thermore , you should reference the Wikipedia article concerning SS .
Always attempt to do your best .
" Behind the Green Door " is the best ero@@ tic@@ a I have ever watched .
